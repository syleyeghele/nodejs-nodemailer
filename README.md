The process is described below:
- I first created a nodejs app
- Then installed nodemailer, express, nodemon, body-parser npm packages
- I then copied the code snipet from nodemailer documentation page
- Then created and generated an app password from my google account to use in sending emails.
- After implementation i then tested by using postman to send the payload which was used to send the email and it was deliveded to the intended address as seen in the screenshot above.
